<H1>WRITE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VAR, LET AND CONST WITH CODE EXAMPLES</H1>
The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.
<H2>Variable</H2>
Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.
The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.


<H2> LET</H2>
The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.
The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.

<H2>CONST</H2>

const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.





var a = 10;
a = 20;
//output: 20
console.log(a);

let b = 'hello';
b = 'world';
//output: 'world'
console.log(b);

const c = 'hello'
//Error: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
c = 'world'
